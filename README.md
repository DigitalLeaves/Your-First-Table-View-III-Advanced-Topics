# My First Table View (III): Behavior and Custom Cells

Sample code for the tutorial "Your First Table View (III)" from Digital Leaves (https://digitalleaves.com)

Welcome back! In this episode of "Your First Table View", we are going to learn how to add a "Swipe to delete" interaction to our cells, alongside other additional actions. Besides, we will learn how to add a "Pull to refresh" control to refresh our table when pulling from the top of the view.

In the previous episodes, we learned the basics of UITableView, Index Paths, Data Sources and Delegates, alongside how to create custom cells and allow our users to select then to transition to new view controllers. You might want to read them first if you have never defined or worked with table views in iOS.
